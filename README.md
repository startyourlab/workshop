## About The Project

The Start Your Lab Workshop is part of an open-source initiative to teach academic research
labs how to leverage modern tools and support them with industry best practices.

### Built With

* [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/)
* [xaringan](https://github.com/yihui/xaringan)
* [pagedown]()

### Installation

To contribute to this project, be sure R and RStudio are up to date on your computer.
Then, clone this repository into your local projects directory and navigate into the
project root:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/startyourlab/workshop
cd workshop
```

Then, open the project in RStudio. When in RStudio, if `xaringan` is not already
installed, run

```r
remotes::install_github('yihui/xaringan')
```

in the R Console. Once installed, load the package via `library(xaringan)`.
To test that everything works, open the `slides.Rmd` file and use the **Knit**
button in the top left of the RStudio window.

### Export to PDF

With the `pagedown` package and Google Chrome, the function `pagedown::chrome_print()`
can export a PDF of the HTML created from the `slides.Rmd` file. To install via the
R Console, run

```r
install.packages('pagedown')
```

then with the project root directory as the working directory, run

```r
pagedown::chrome_print('slides.Rmd')
```
